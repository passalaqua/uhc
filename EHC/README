The Utrecht Haskell Compiler (UHC)
==================================

This is the top directory of the UHC source tree, for the compiler and
the tools and libraries required to build UHC. UHC grew out of the
Essential Haskell Compiler (EHC) project, but the name EHC will
gradually not be used overtime. The web entry point for information
about UHC is:

	http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/UHC/WebHome

Here the elaborate instructions for getting started and downloading can
be found.


Installation
============

The short version for installing uhc (from either binary or
source distribution) is:

	./configure
	make				# optional
	make install		# may require admin permission

More detailed information currently still labeled with EHC can be found
here:

	http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/Ehc/WebHome


Experimentation (optional)
==========================

If you want to compile UHC Core files (e.g. generated using the uhc-light package), use the following configure invocation:
./configure --enable-core-asinpoutp
 

The following ./configure invocations lead to buildable compilers
20140331:
	./configure --with-aspects="base"							# only ASTs, parser, pretty printing
	./configure --with-aspects="base hmtyinfer noHmTyRuler"		# + HM type system (without use of ruler system)
	./configure --with-aspects="base hmtyast"					# only Ty infrastructure without its use
