If no full solution is possible, we just use the superclass relationship.
- This relationship is fixed, so closed world choice works here.
- We also allow for ambiguity here, randomly picking an alternative, the first. This is not good, but will work for now...

Previous heuristic did not behave ghc alike in that instances were eagerly used, also when it still would lead to unresolved predicates.
These would then end up in the context of a function, the early decision inhibiting the use of other instances at a later moment:

heurScopedEHC :: FIIn' gm -> Heuristic CHRPredOcc RedHowAnnotation
heurScopedEHC env
  = toHeuristic
    $ ifthenelseSHeuristic isEqHeuristic
